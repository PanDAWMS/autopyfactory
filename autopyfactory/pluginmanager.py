"""
  APF Module to handle plugins dispatch, config.
  Not named 'plugins' because there is a lib directory with that name.  

  Model is plugins are kept in hierarchy by 'category':
    factory: plugins that the factory uses
    queue:   plugins that APFQueues use
    profile:  plugins looked up by label
    
  Beneath the catetogory, there are types
    factory:
       config:
         file
         agis
       monitor:
         apfmon
    queue:
       wmsstatus:

Plugins initialized with ConfigParser object and a section name as arguments. The 
assumption is that the classes themselves know how to look up the info they need. 
It is also assumed that Singleton/non-Singleton decision is made during class initialization.
