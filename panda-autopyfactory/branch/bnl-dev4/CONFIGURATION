AutoPyFactory CONFIGURATION

Configuration of APF functionality is handled through four files, whose
locations depend on method of installation:

FILE                RPM LOCATION            USER LOCATION  
factory.sysconfig   /etc/sysconfig/         ~/etc/
factory.conf        /etc/apf                ~/etc/
queues.conf         /etc/apf                ~/etc/
proxy.conf          /etc/apf                ~/etc/

For factory.conf, queues.conf, and proxy.conf files, simply copy the 
example files within the etc/ directory, removing the '-example' suffix. Edit 
each file in turn, following the instructions below and the commented hints 
within the config files.
