AutoPyFactory INSTALL-USER

User installation assumes that APF will be installed in the users home directory using the 
standard Python distutils setup commands. It assumes that pre-requisites have already
been installed and properly configured, either within the user's home directory or on
the general system. 


Prerequisites:
   -- Python  
   -- Condor (Condor-G)
   -- Panda Client library 
   -- simplejson
   
   
Unlike the root/RPM install, you must add ~/lib/python to your PYTHONPATH:

  export PYTHONPATH=~/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH
