2011-03-28

* Update configuration example to Peter's new monitoring URl.

* If this is a ptest pilot use Paul's development pilot code (override with
  PILOT_HTTP_SOURCES still possible).

* This release is "The Captain". v1.2.0.

  Now the Captain called me to his bed 
  He fumbled for my hand 
  "Take these silver bars," he said 
  "I'm giving you command." 
  "Command of what, there's no one here 
  There's only you and me -
  All the rest are dead or in retreat 
  Or with the enemy." 

2011-03-17

* Only try to use python2.6 if the env var APF_PYTHON26 is defined.

2011-03-16

* Prepended "FACTORY DEBUG:" to the setup of the panda client environment
  variables which get set before logging is enabled (this confused
  some people).
  
* Use traceback.format_exc() to dump exceptions properly into the 
  configured factory logger ("raise" sends output to stderr).

2011-01-13

* If PANDA_URL_CONF or PANDA_URL are set then do not alter them.

2010-12-15

* Support 'allowothercountry" for beyond the pledge resources. (Default False).

* Set the PANDA_URL_CONF and PANDA_URL environment variables to use the 
  panda server squid port (25085). Suppress this by setting the APF_NOSQUID
  environment variable.
  
* Download of queue data also now happens via the squid cache.

* Monitoring improvement to help scale better. Removal of monitoring cron jobs.

* This is the "Silent Running" release. Look after the plants, Dewey.
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Running

2010-11-22

* Changed default sleep time to 120s.

* N.B. Monitoring requires pycurl (install standard python-curl RPM).

2010-11-05

* Wrapper now supports environment variables starting with APF_FORCE_ 
  which set the environment variable with APF_FORCE_ stripped off.
  This is needed when setting the normal environment variable via
  condor-g fails because it gets overwritten by the site shell setup.

2010-09-15

* Removed deprecated code from runpilot3-wrapper.sh (uudecode and broken
  site hacks).

* This is the "Time Out of Joint" release. This pilot factory does not 
  exist. It is a small text file on your computer containing the words
  "Pilot Factory":
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Out_of_Joint

2010-07-24

* Corrected bug where "site" parameter was used instead of "siteid" to get
  panda job states (broke ANALY sites for which these are different). 
  Reported by Xavi, diagnosed by Graeme, fixed by Peter.

* Reintroduced support for CREAM CEs - factory now detects CREAM CEs and
  provides the correct JDL to condor (recommended only for use with 
  condor >= 7.5.3). See configuration example for how to support this.
  
* Changed JDL for gt2 GRAM sumbission from anachronistic "universe = globus"
  to "universe = grid; grid_resource = gt2 GATEKEEPER_URL".

* Changed from 'jdl' field in schedconfig to 'queue', which is a better name 
  and has the correct value for condor sites ('jdl' supported but 
  deprecated).

* Changed default proxy location to /tmp/prodRoleProxy and pilotRoleProxy.
  This can still be inherited from X509_USER_PROXY.
  
* Changed the default source proxy to /tmp/plainProxy.

* Changed handling of deprecated keys to rewrite the configuration objects
  themselves, which gives more robust and consistent handling. Unknown
  keys are deleted and a warning printed.
  
* Schedconfig download failures are now errors (not warnings).

2010-06-01

* Changed argument passed to pilot from 'site' to 'siteid', which is correct
  and necessary for ANALY_ sites.
  
* Added new internal status of 'error' where queue has siteid=None. This 
  suppresses pilot submission to that queue.
  
* Added new configuration option for the [QueueDefaults] section 
  'analysisGridProxy' which is the default proxy used for ANALY_ sites.

* Default setting for 'user' of ANALY queues is now 'user' (can still be
  overwritten). 
  
* ATLAS software release areas are now ordered correctly by a python code
  snippet in the wrapper which correctly compares 'rel_M-N'. 
  
* Updated release number to 1.0.1.

* This is the "Feersum Endjinn" release:
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feersum_Endjinn

2010-04-09

* Added protection in submission logic against None value for 
  depthboost.

* Updated example configuration file.

* Changed configuration logic so that override = True prevents loading
  of schedconfig values only for those values set in the factory
  configuration (previously this completely supressed schedconfig
  loading).

* Renamed various parameters to their new schedconfig names (Oracle 
  column names are case insensitive, so become lower case). 
  	pilotDepth -> nqueue
    pilotDepthBoost -> depthboost
    idlePilotSuppression -> idlepilotsuppression
    pilotLimit -> pilotlimit
    transferringLimit -> transferringlimit
    env -> environ
  Old names are still supported for now, but generate a warning message.

* Changed submission logic for sites in test mode to keep one pilot
  queued, but up to nqueue running (better throughput for site
  revalidation).

* Moved import exception handling to main factory.py script.

2010-03-22

* Restructured logging to inherit from main logging class (deprecated
  global logging to console). Logging now definable as an option
  (syslog, rotating file, stdout). N.B. Default logging is now to
  syslog - if you want the old behaviour set --output=stdout.

* Rewrote JDL to have separate condor log file for each individual job.
  Will help integrate with panda monitoring.
  
* Added limit setting code. Wrapper will always set a file size of 20GB to 
  prevent mad jobs from killing a worker node. If the queue has a memory
  limit set, then the pilot also sets this as the VMEM limit in the
  shell.

* Removed panda server Client.getSiteSpecs() call. Better to get individual
  queue statuses from schedconfig (fixes https://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?62751) 
  
* Deprecated status=ok,disabled (should be online, offline). Prints warning
  for now, but remains supported.

2010-03-19

* Internal merge with latest pyfactory trunk (the old release).

2010-03-18

* Setting filesize limit (20GB) and optionally memory limit in pilot wrapper.

2010-02-11 "Tyger! Tyger!" Release (r130 factory.py; r128 runpilot3-wrapper.sh)

* Incorporated Rod's patch to support CREAM CEs.

* Corrected handling of X509_USER_PROXY environment variable and added
  explicit addition of x509userproxy to JDL.

* Proxy is now defined per queue, enabling support for multi-role pilot
  factories with recent condor versions.

* Pilot tarball now downloaded from pandaserver.cern.ch, removing one
  dependency of job workflow on the panda monitor.

* Revised runpilot3-wrapper.sh which removed explict addition of
  python library installation from the ATLAS s/w area (reversed part 2
  of change 2 from "gunpowder").

* Corrected an error in detecting OSG sites in runpilot3-wrapper.sh
  (thanks to Rod).

* Reintroduced the idlePilotNumber parameter, which controls how many
  pilots are send during an idling cycle (it's useful for stress
  testing sites).

* Fixed a race condition in the vomsrenew.sh script.

* This release is for William Blake smoking opium at Chinese New Year.


2009-11-24 "900" Release (r35 runpilot3-wrapper.sh)

* Define ATLAS_AREA internal variable
  =$VO_ATLAS_SW_DIR for EGEE sites
  =$OSG_APP/atlas_app/atlas_rel for OSG sites

* Source $ATLAS_AREA/local/setup.sh if it exists.

* This release inspired by 900GeV collisions:
  http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/public/EVTDISPLAY/atlas2009-collision-atlantis-141749-406601-hits-web.png


2009-11-05 "Gunpowder" Release (r25)

* Changed SVN repository to svn.cern.ch/reps/scotgrid/atlas/pyfactory.
  (Verison number plunged down!)

* Made wrapper more intelligent in changing system PYTHONPATH to get
  32 bit lfc module, which helps on sites with 64 bit middleware. Also
  added ATLAS python library explicitly ahead of system python to
  prevent old libraries from being loaded by accident.

* Updated wrapper script to prefer TMPDIR over EDG_WL_SCRATCH (later
  is an anachronism from the lcg-RB).

* Source DDM setup.sh to ensure pilot has access to dq2 modules.

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder_Plot


2009-07-08 "Totoro" Release (r635)

* Introduced "country" and "group" parameters for queues. These map to
  the pilot's -o and -v options allowing for pilots which only pick up
  particular types of jobs.

* Polling for queues now intelligently uses the country and group
  options above to only send pilots when activated jobs of that type
  are present at a site.

* Introduced "cloud" option to tag a queue to a panda cloud.

* Site and cloud status are polled and if 'offline' then pilot
  submission is supressed; if a site/cloud is in 'test' status then
  the pyfactory status flips to 'test' as well (limits pilot flow).

* Introuduced 'pilotDepthBoost' parameter (default 2), which allows
  the factory to submit up to queueDepth * pilotDepthBoost into a
  non-started state if there are sufficient jobs activated. This helps
  a lot if the site has short jobs where the lags in job status
  updates mean that sites can run short of pilots. You may want to set
  this higher at T1s (especially when doing reco).
  This is a more controlled version of the short job patch which was
  released in June 2009.

* Corrected a small bug in the default queue specification so that it
  works properly.

* Renamed the 'suppression' option to 'idlePilotSuppression'.

* Distributed wrapper script is now called "runpilot3-wrapper.sh",
  which is a much more sensible name.

* Default server is now pandaserver.cern.ch.

* Updated INSTALLATION file for new panda client location in SVN.

* Updates to README, INSTALLATION, Makefile corresponding to the above
  changes.

* Eilish wanted this release called 'Totoro', after one of her
  favourite Hayao Miyazaki films,
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Neighbour_Totoro.


2008-10-08 "Dawn Treader" Release (r485)

* GPL license.

* Internal defaults now work properly.

* Support for multiple gatekeepers on the same site. These are
  configured as space separated lists and the factory round robins
  between them each cycle (see sample configuration file). If you use
  this a lot then an expansion syntax could be supported - ask.

* Added a new parameter "supression". If this is > 1 then an idling
  pilot is only submitted to a site every "supression" cycles. Use
  this to mollify sysadmins in your cloud who get grumpy when pilots
  don't pick up. (When the site has activated jobs submission is as
  it was before.) Caveat Emptor: this will affect brokering.

* Added new panda server parameters "server" and "port" which let the
  pilot look for jobs from a different panda server. These do not need
  to be set for most factories (default settings:
  https://pandasrv.usatlas.bnl.gov:25443).

* Added a new parameter "env" which can list extra environment
  variables to be set for the pilot by condor. (N.B. be careful if you
  set a [QueueDefaults] value for "env" - the site's value will
  _overwrite_, not add to, the environment. If there is sufficient
  demand I can change this behaviour.)

* Changed runpilot3-script-stub.sh to unset all https_proxy
  environment variables at a site as this proxy mechanism is broken
  and rarely necessary for panda server ports.

* Support for multiple configuration files. These are all loaded and
  all are reloaded if any of them change. e.g.,
  --conf=generic.conf,uk.conf,analysis.conf
  N.B. Configuration files are loaded left to right and latter
  (re)defined options overwrite earlier ones.

* Print a warning if queue "status" value is invalid.

* Ruben named this release "Dawn Treader" after his favourite Narnia
  book so far. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_Treader.


2008-06-17 "Moominsummer Madness" Release (r458)

* Updated pilot http download to pandamon.usatlas.bnl.gov.

* Added a timeout to curl for pilot tarball download (30s on
  connection, 180s total).

* Fixed the cleanLogs.py script so it now deletes old archived log
  files.

* Minor changes to documentation.

* No longer including a wrapper with a pilot uuencoded into it as it's
  recommended to download the latest pilot on the fly.

* Dedication: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tove_Jansson


2008-04-16 "Umber Hulk" Release. (r442)

* Upgraded runpilot3.sh to UHURA 18f pilot.

* Modified the order of the search for an LFC compatible python. The
  ATLAS release python is now tested first (it's usually more recent
  than the OS version). N.B. This may provoke a run time python
  warning about an API mismatch between the python versions.

* Added factoryId to configuration. This allows multiple factories to
  run on the same machine. This factory ID is used as the PANDA_JSID
  passed to the panda dashboard.

* Added baseLogFileUrl to pass the correct URL for the pilot wrapper's
  logfiles to the panda dashboard.

* Added optional "user" field to allow pilots to be sent to pick up
  particular types of jobs from panda, using the "-u USER" argument.
  If this is absent or None then nothing is passed with the pilot
  arguments (i.e., pickup normal production jobs).

* Changed configuration so that each configuration section is a
  "queue" which can have a gatekeeper section. This allows pilots to
  be sent to the same queue on the CE, but having different "user"
  parameters. If there is no "gatekeeper" specified then the name of
  the configuration section name is the gatekeeper contact string, as
  before.

* New example factory configuration file, factory.conf-example makes
  use of the above clearer.

* Many internal changes to support the above feature.

* Modified the main submit code to sort alphabetically by queue name.

* cleanLogs.py now much improved. Will read factory log file directory
  location from factory.conf. Options for verbosity, days to compress
  after and days to delete after.

* This release is dedicated to Gary Gygax. d20... 19 hit!
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Gygax


2008-02-28 "Ice Moon" Release. (r436)

* Upgraded tarball to UHURA12a pilot.

* Added makefile target to rebuild the wrapper script with pilot
  tarball downloaded from subversion (you need svn installed!).

* Changed tarball http download to use BNL cache first, with fallback
  to Glasgow (Glasgow will rebuild nightly).

* Much better exception handling if there is a problem polling condor
  status or panda status - factory raises an internal exception and
  then skips a cycle.

* Added an outer level exception handler which gives instructions as
  to how to report the error then reraises error.


2008-02-08 "It's REALLY all about me" Release. (r416)

* Updated to UHURA11b2-2 pilot.


2008-02-08 "It's all about me" Release. (r410)

* Major change to pilot delivery mechanism, attaching pilot tarball as
  a uuencoded suffix of the wrapper script. This cures problems with
  batch systems which do not deliver "input" files properly on STDIN
  (bqs - there was nothing there; condor - crashes job).

  *** YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE input PARAMETER FROM factory.conf.

* Added GTAG environment variable to move towards integration with
  panda dashboard (as autopilot does).

* Fixed a bug where the factory would crash if the condor_q query
  failed (factory now raises a CondorStatusFailure exception, catches
  it and skips a cycle).

* Fixed a bug where exception arguments were improperly specified.

* Added the "-k MEM" flag to pilot where a site has a memory limit
  specified (should be used for sites lacking memory).

* Cosmetic: print timestamp at the beginning of each submit cycle.

* Upgraded to UHURA11a pilot as default.

* Improved cleanLogs.py script and renamed mkPilotWrapper.py.
