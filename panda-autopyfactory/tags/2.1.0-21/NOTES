AutoPyFactory NOTES

BUILDING
To build this package from source do
          
          python setup.py bdist --formats=rpm

Because of a problem in the way Redhat flavour RPMs are built
you must have this rpm macro defined:

       %_unpackaged_files_terminate_build 0

which prevents rpmbuild from failing because of the .pyo files which
get built automatically.

The easiest way to do this is to add that line to ~/.rpmmacros:

  echo %_unpackaged_files_terminate_build 0 >> ~/.rpmmacros

N.B. You must have the rpm-build package installed, or distutils will
fallback to rpm and fail.


PILOT WRAPPER
With the v2.0 release, a new top-level generic wrapper (libexec/wrapper.sh) is 
included with the distribution. This top-level wrapper is part of a complete 
multi-level wrapper system created by Jose Caballero. 

The top-level wrapper is intended to rarely (if ever) require changes. It simply 
pulls the next-level wrapper from the provided URL and executes it. This, in turn, 
pulls and executes more specific functionality to adjust for grid, VO, project, 
purpose. 

Please email caballer@bnl.gov for any wrapper-related issues. 


MONITORING
The AutoPyFactory Monitor is a separate project. Enable monitoring by including
this line in the factory.conf, then visit the URL for the web interface:
    monitorURL = http://py-dev.lancs.ac.uk/mon/

By default monitoring is disabled. Please email p.love@lancaster.ac.uk for
any monitoring questions.

PLUGIN ARCHITECTURE

With the v2.0 refactoring, various aspects of the internal functioning 
were converted over to a plugin architecture. 

factory (shell) 
  -> factory.py -- handles command line args, config file parsing,    
      executes:
        -> Factory (singleton)--top-level handler, p deals with queue threads 
           contains:
              Monitor (singleton)--handles updates to APF monitor. 
              ProxyManager
              BatchStatus (singleton)--queries underlying batch system for 
                use by all PandaQueues
              PandaQueue (xN) (one for each Panda site-queue)
              contains:
                 BatchStatus -- Retrieves and encapsulates job status for a 
                   queue from underlying batch system.  
                 BatchSubmit -- Handles submission (JDL creation, submit) to 
                   underlying batch system. 
                 SchedPlugin -- Calculates number of jobs to submit        
                 QueueInfo
