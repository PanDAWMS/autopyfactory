# baseLogDir =  where outputs from pilots are stored
#               NOTE: No trailing '/'!!!
#
# baseLogDirUrl = where outputs from pilots are available via http.
#               NOTE: It must include the port.
#               NOTE: No trailing '/'!!!
#
# batchstatus.condor.sleep = time the Condor BatchStatus Plugin waits between cycles
#               Value is in seconds.
#
# batchstatus.maxtime = maximum time while the info is considered reasonable. 
#               If info stored is older than that, is considered not valid, 
#               and some NULL output will be returned.
#
# cycles = maximum number of times the queues will loop. 
#               None means forever.
#
# cleanlogs.keepdays = maximum number of days the condor logs
#               will be kept, in case they are placed in a subdirectory
#               for an APFQueue that is not being currently managed by 
#               AutoPyFactory.
#               For example, an apfqueue that has been created and used for a short
#               amount of time, and it does not exist anymore.
#               Still the created logs have to be cleaned at some point...
#
# enablequeues = default value to enable/disable all queues at once. 
#               When True, its value will be overriden by the queue config variable 'enabled',
#               queue by queue. 
#               When False, all queues will stop working, 
#               but the factory will still be alive performing basic actions (eg. printing logs).
#
# factoryId = Name that the factory instance will have in the APF web monitor. 
#               Make factoryId something descriptive and unique for your factory,
#               for example <site>-<host>-<admin> (e.g. BNL-gridui11-jhover)
#
# factoryAdminEmail = Email of the local admin to contact in case of a problem
#               with an specific APF instance.
#
# factorySMTPServer = Server to use to send alert emails to admin. 
#
# factory.sleep = sleep time between cycles in mainLoop in Factory object
#               Value is in seconds.
#
# factoryUser = account under which APF will run
#
# maxperfactory.maximum = maximum number of condor jobs 
#               to be running at the same time per Factory.
#               It is a global number, used by all APFQueues submitting
#               pilots with condor.
#               The value will be used by MaxPerFactorySchedPlugin plugin
#
#
# logserver.enabled = determines if batch logs are exported via HTTP.
#               Valid values are True|False
#
# logserver.index = determines if automatic directory indexing is allowed
#               when log directories are browsed. 
#               Valid values are True|False
#
# logserver.allowrobots = if false, creates a robots.txt file in the docroot. 
#               Valid valudes are True|False
#
# proxyConf = local path to the configuration file for automatic proxy management.
#             NOTE: must be a local path, not a URI. 
#
# proxymanager.enabled = to determine if automatic proxy management is used or not.
#               Accepted values are True|False
#
# proxymanager.sleep =  Sleep interval for proxymanager thread. 
#
# queueConf = URI plus path to the configuration file for APF queues.
#             NOTE: Must be expressed as a URI (file:// or http://)
#             Cannot be used at the same time that queueDirConf
#
# queueDirConf = directory with a set of configuration files, 
#            all of them to be used at the same time. 
#            i.e.  /etc/autopyfactory/queues.d/
#            Cannot be used at the same time that queueConf
#
# monitorConf = local path to the configuration file for Monitor plugins.
#
# mappingsConf = local path to the configuration file with the mappings:
#                for example, globus2info, jobstatus2info, etc.
#
# wmsstatus.maximum = maximum time while the info is considered reasonable. 
#               If info stored is older than that, is considered not valid, 
#               and some NULL output will be returned.
#
# wmsstatus.panda.sleep = time the WMSStatus Plugin waits between cycles
#               Value is in seconds.
