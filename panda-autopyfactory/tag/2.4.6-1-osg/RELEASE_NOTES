=============================================================================
                    RELEASE SEMANTICS
=============================================================================

AutoPyFactory release versions are composed by 4 numbers:

        major.minor.release-build

For example: 1.2.3-4

* A change in the major number means the entire architecture of 
  AutoPyFactory has been redesign. It implies a change at the conceptual
  level. In other words, changing the major number means a new project. 

* A change in the configuration files that requires sys admins intervention
  after updating implies a change in the minor number.

* Implementing a new relevant feature implies changing the minor number.

* A significative amount of code refactoring that may affect the performance
  of AutoPyFactory -including speed, memory usage, disk usage, etc-
  implies changing the minor number.

* Small features and bug fixes imply changing the release number. 

* A change in the RPM package but not in the code are reflected in the
  build number.

* Not all new releases are placed in the production RPM repository. 
  Many of them are available at the development and testing repositories, 
  but only those that have been verified to work are moved 
  to the production repository. 

* Same RPM will have always the same numbers in all repositories.

------------------------------------------
      version 2.4.0
------------------------------------------

Version 2.4.0 introduces major changes in name of files and directories, 
programs, users accounts, processes, etc. 
This recipe should help with a step by step migration:
        
        
        1. stop the factory
        
            $ service factory stop
        
        2. install RPM for autopyfactory-2.4.0
        
        first, it is needed to removed the previous installation and the one for autopyfactory-tools, 
        if it is installed, since there are incompatible requirements
        This will delete some files and directories. If you customized the logrotation, you may want to make a copy first.
        Also make a security copy of the configuration directory
        
            $ cp /etc/logrotate.d/autopyfactory.logrotate /tmp/
        
            $ cp /etc/sysconfig/factory.sysconfig /tmp/
        
            $ mkdir /tmp/etc/
            $ cp /etc/apf/* /tmp/etc/
        
        Remove the packages:
        
            $ rpm -e panda-autopyfactory panda-autopyfactory-tools
        
        Install the new autopyfactory package:
        
            $ yum install autopyfactory
        
        3. directory /etc/autopyfactory/ has been created, but it is empty. 
        The examples for the config files are placed under
        
                /usr/share/doc/autopyfactory-2.4.0/
        
        Also the examples for  logrotate and sysconfig files are in there:
        
                /usr/share/doc/autopyfactory-2.4.0/logrotate/
                /usr/share/doc/autopyfactory-2.4.0/sysconfig/
        
        The old config files are still under  
        
                /etc/apf/ 
        
        and the old sysconfig is still as
        
                /etc/sysconfig/factory.sysconfig
        
        
        4. sysconfig
        
        Option 1: copy the new one
        
                $ cp /usr/share/doc/autopyfactory-2.4.0/sysconfig/autopyfactory-example /etc/sysconfig/autopyfactory
        
        Option 2: copy the old one
        
                $ cp /tmp/factory.sysconfig  /etc/sysconfig/autopyfactory
        
        In the second case, some adjustments may be needed:
        
                *  replace      --runas=apf                           -->  --runas=autopyfactory
                *  replace      --log=/var/log/apf/apf.log            -->  --log=/var/log/autopyfactory/autopyfactory.log
                *  replace      CONSOLE_LOG=/var/log/apf/console.log  -->  CONSOLE_LOG=/var/log/autopyfactory/console.log
        
        
        5. log rotation
        
        Option 1: copy the new one
        
                $ cp /usr/share/doc/autopyfactory-2.4.0/logrotate/autopyfactory-example /etc/logrotate.d/autopyfactory
        
        Option 2: copy the old one (saved in /tmp/)
        
                $ cp /tmp/autopyfactory.logrotate /etc/logrotate.d/autopyfactory
        
        In the second case, some adjustments may be needed:
        
                * replace       /var/log/apf/apf.log         -->     /var/log/autopyfactory/autopyfactory.log
                * replace       /var/log/apf/console.log     -->     /var/log/autopyfactory/console.log
                * replace       /etc/init.d/factory          -->     /etc/init.d/autopyfactory
        
        6. autopyfactory.conf
        
        Option 1: copy the new one
        
                $ cp /usr/share/doc/autopyfactory-2.4.0/autopyfactory.conf-example  /etc/autopyfactory/autopyfactory.conf
        
        Option 2: copy the old one
        
                $ cp /tmp/etc/factory.conf /etc/autopyfactory/autopyfactory.conf
        
        In the second case, some adjustments may be needed:
        
                * replace        factoryUser = apf                           -->  factoryUser = autopyfactory
                * replace        queueConf = file:///etc/apf/queues.conf     -->  queueConf = file:///etc/autopyfactory/queues.conf
                * replace        queueDirConf = /etc/apf/queues.d/           -->  queueDirConf = /etc/autopyfactory/queues.d/
                * replace        proxyConf = /etc/apf/proxy.conf             -->  proxyConf = /etc/autopyfactory/proxy.conf
                * replace        monitorConf = file:///etc/apf/monitor.conf  -->  monitorConf = /etc/autopyfactory/monitor.conf
                * replace        baseLogDir = /home/apf/factory/logs         -->  baseLogDir = /home/autopyfactory/factory/logs
                * add line    
                     mappingsConf = /etc/autopyfactory/mappings.conf
        
        
        7. queues.conf
        
        Option 1: copy the new one
        
                $ cp /usr/share/doc/autopyfactory-2.4.0/queues.conf-example  /etc/autopyfactory/queues.conf
        
        Option 2: copy the old one
        
                $ cp /tmp/etc/queues.conf /etc/autopyfactory/queues.conf
        
        In the first case, the file needs to be configured from scratch.
        In the second case, no adjustments is needed.
        
        8. proxy.conf
        
        Option 1: copy the new one
        
                $ cp /usr/share/doc/autopyfactory-2.4.0/proxy.conf-example  /etc/autopyfactory/proxy.conf
        
        Option 2: copy the old one
        
                $ cp /tmp/etc/proxy.conf /etc/autopyfactory/proxy.conf
        
        In the first case, the file needs to be configured from scratch.
        In the second case, no adjustments is needed.
        
        
        9. monitor.conf
        
        Option 1: copy the new one
        
                $ cp /usr/share/doc/autopyfactory-2.4.0/monitor.conf-example  /etc/autopyfactory/monitor.conf
        
        Option 2: copy the old one
        
                $ cp /tmp/etc/monitor.conf /etc/autopyfactory/monitor.conf
        
        In the first case, the file needs to be configured from scratch, but most probably the default configuration is enough.
        In the second case, no adjustments is needed.
        
        10. mappings.conf
        
        This config file is new, so it must be copied 
        
                $ cp /usr/share/doc/autopyfactory-2.4.0/mappings.conf-example  /etc/autopyfactory/mappings.conf
        
        Do not touch it.
        
        
        11. since the factory will now run as user "autopyfactory" instead of "apf", the new UNIX account needs to be created.
        
                $ useradd autopyfactory
        
            assuming that account also hosts the keys for the X509 proxies in the regular directory .globus:
        
                $ mkdir ~autopyfactory/.globus
                $ cp -r ~apf/.globus/* ~autopyfactory/.globus/
                $ chown -R autopyfactory:autopyfactory ~autopyfactory/.globus
        
            if that is not the case, then copy the .pem keys and/or change their ownership.
        
        
        and to avoid problems, delete the current X509 that may still be in /tmp/
        
        12. Install autopyfactory-tools
        
                $ yum install autopyfactory-tools
        
        13. start the factory
        
            $ service autofactory start
        
        
        WARNING: after migrating to 2.4.0, factory runs under user "autopyfactory" instead of "apf".
        That means no one will now clean the old directories /var/log/apf/ and ~apf/factory/logs/
        You may delete them at some point (not right away, since they will include condor logs for still running pilots)
        

------------------------------------------
      version 2.3.2
------------------------------------------
* RPM built incorrectly. Rebuilt against correct copy of code.  

------------------------------------------
      version 2.3.1
------------------------------------------
* Minor fixes to Condor submit plugin initialization. 

* Fix to determining username for email. 

------------------------------------------
      version 2.3.0
------------------------------------------

* utils not distributed anymore within the RPM. They will be distributed with a dedicated one.

* variable 'flavor' mandatory in DEFAULT section in proxy.conf
  Values are voms or myproxy

* In case flavor=myproxy in proxy.conf, then variables
    remote_host
    remote_user
    remote_owner
    remote_group
  are needed too.

* New variable factorySMTPServer  in factory.conf

* New variable proxymanager.sleep in factory.conf


------------------------------------------
      version 2.2.0-1
------------------------------------------

* examples of executables (a.k.a. wrappers) 
  are placed underneath the '/etc/apf/' directory.
  They are not copied directly into '/usr/libexec/' anymore.

  'wrapper-0.9.9.sh' has a different set of
  input options than previous one. 
  Read carefully the inline documentation before using it.

* Config plugins have been removed. 
  Any configuration variable in 'queues.conf'
  related 'PandaConfig' or 'AGISConfig' plugins 
  are not valid anymore. 
  Therefore the variable 'configplugin' is gone too.

  Variables 'override' and 'autofill' are also gone.

* There is a new configuration file called 'monitor.conf'
  An example is provided underneath '/etc/apf/'

  Old variable in 'factory.conf' pointing to the monitor URL
  is now in 'monitor.conf'  

  The 'monitor.conf' contains sections
  for different monitor configurations.
  The name of the section is setup in 'queues.conf' via
  the new variable 'monitorsection'

  Read carefully the inline documentation in
  'monitor.conf' before using it.

* Utils, including script to generate 'queues.conf'
  with information from AGIS, have changed name and location.
  New scripts are place underneath '/usr/share/apf'

------------------------------------------
      version 2.1.1-3
