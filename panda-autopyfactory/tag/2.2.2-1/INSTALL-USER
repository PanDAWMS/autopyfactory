AutoPyFactory INSTALL-USER

User installation assumes that APF will be installed in the user's home directory using the 
standard Python distutils setup commands. It assumes that pre-requisites have already
been installed and properly configured, either within the user's home directory or on
the general system. 

Software Prerequisites
----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Python 2.4 or above:
	-- Comes default with RHEL 5+ and most current operating systems.    
 	 
* python-simplejson:
	-- Available in stock RHEL 5+. yum install python-simplejson
    -- http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/
    
* python-pycurl:
	-- Available in stock RHEL 5+. yum install python-pycurl
       (We will work to eliminate this prerequisite by using pure Python urllib.) 
    -- http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/download/

* voms-proxy-* tools:
	-- Available in stock RHEL 5+. yum install voms-clients
	-- Or install the OSG client
     
* Condor 7.6 or above:
	-- http://research.cs.wisc.edu/condor/      
      
* Panda Client userinterface Python library:

    mkdir ~/lib/python
	cd ~/lib/python
    svn co http://svnweb.cern.ch/guest/panda/panda-server/current/pandaserver/userinterface

Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Check out the project from SVN, or download the tarball, and install

     svn co http://svnweb.cern.ch/guest/panda/panda-autopyfactory/current/ panda-autopyfactory
     cd panda-autopyfactory
     python setup.py install --home=~/
     

2) Unless you are running a Python installed in your home directory, you must 
   add ~/lib/python to your PYTHONPATH. The preferred way is to add the following
   to your ~/.bash_profile
      
      export PYTHONPATH=~/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH
      
Configuration
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Copy the configuration -example files to their final names. And adjust the variables
   within to reasonable values. Each configuration file has detailed instructions on proper
   settings for various purposes. 
   
       cd $HOME/etc
       cp factory.conf-example factory.conf
       cp queues.conf-example queues.conf
       cp proxy.conf-example proxy.conf
       cp factory.sysconfig-example factory.sysconfig

Notable issues for initial installation or upgrades:

-- Be aware that the factoryId in factory.conf will be what your factory appears under on the 
   APF monitor. Once chosen, it will be awkward to change it. See
       http://apfmon.lancs.ac.uk/mon/

-- The integrated proxy management (proxy.conf) and log serving (logserver.* variables in 
   factory.conf) are new with 2.X. Be sure you understand them before moving beyond testing.
 
-- Because of the way gatekeepers cache job executables, changing the file used as a job wrapper
   does not necessarily trigger an update of that filename on site gatekeepers. The only way to
   guarantee a re-send of a wrapper file is to rename it (or make a unique symlink) and change 
   the executable var in queues.conf e.g.,
        executable = /usr/libexec/wrapper ->  executable/libexec/wrapper-0.9.4.sh 
   We intend to look into this issue to hide it from the factory administrator, but for now it
   is an unavoidable problem. 

              
2) Start the factory, and trace the log files to determine if behavior is as expected:

       cd $HOME/etc
       ./factory start
       tail -f ~/var/log/apf.log
