Roadmap
---------------
See https://svn.racf.bnl.gov/trac/gridgroup/wiki/AutoPyFactory for most up to date list, and other
longer-term plans.

* Currently there are several Condor batch submit plugin files (GT2, EC2, Local) 
  which share a lot of code. If these can be unified cleanly, that is the plan. 
  
* We need to do more sanity checking during object initialization, e.g. the Condor plugins
  should confirm executables on the PATH, and that Condor is running. And we need to decide
  to either consider problems fatal overall, or make sure dependent components can either cope
  or stop, rather than forging onward with possible errors.   
  
* Fatal error handling is in place, but we need finer-grained error detection, reaction, and recovery.
