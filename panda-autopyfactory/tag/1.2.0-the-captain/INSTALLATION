Installation
------------

1. Get yourself a condor_g installed. Instructions are here:
   https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki//bin/view/Atlas/CondorG, with the
   following caveats:

    condorg.cern.ch doesn't exist anymore, but you don't need it. In
    condor_config set

    CONDOR_HOST = my.pilot.factory.host.name

    and (much lower down) set

    DAEMON_LIST = MASTER, SCHEDD, COLLECTOR

    as well as setting your email address in CONDOR_ADMIN.

    You should submit a test job to your favourite site to ensure it's
    working (use the JDL on the twiki page, change the globusscheduler
    to the gatekeeper URL and rsl string to the site's queue).


2. Checkout the panda client code from SVN:
   $ mkdir ~/panda
   $ svn co http://svnweb.cern.ch/guest/panda/panda-server/current/pandaserver/userinterface
   $ export PYTHONPATH=~/panda:$PYTHONPATH
   Make sure the PYTHONPATH is defined for the factory's environment.
   
3. If you are using python < 2.6 then install the simplejson module
   (you do not need the C speedups, so the python module files are
   sufficient). Make sure simplejson is also in your PYTHONPATH.
   
   http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/

4. Install the autopyfactory RPM or tarball.

5. Create a factory.conf for your sites. Usually this should live in 
   /opt/panda/autopyfactory/etc. (You will want to chown it to the
   autopyfactory user, it's installed as root from the RPM.)

   In the configuration you need to:

   Change factoryOwner to be your email address (I've never got an
   email from a condor job, but one day maybe I will...).

   Change factoryId to be a unique identifier for this factory
   instance - try to make it meaningful for someone else looking at
   the monitoring, e.g., "factoryId = graeme-UK-apf".

   Change baseLogDir to somewhere with a lot of space - pilot outputs
   can fill up a lot of disk once you are running well. The factory
   will store outputs for a queue in
   baseLogDir/YYYY-MM-DD/QUEUE_NAME/.

   It's very useful to have this directory available over http
   so that sites can see how pilots are working at their sites
   (e.g., http://svr017.gla.scotgrid.ac.uk/factory/logs/). Define this
   path as baseLogDirUrl. This string is passed to the panda dashboard.

   Define your sites. factory.conf-example shows how to do this. In 
   autopyfactory you should generally let the factory pull all the
   configuration parameters from schedconfig.
   
   If you wish schedconfig values to be ignored then set
   
     override = True
     
   for this queue.

   Note that multiple configuration files can be used. These are comma 
   separated, e.g.,

   $ factory.py --conf=generic.conf,factory-1.conf,factory-2.conf

6. Get a VOMS proxy: production for production, pilot for user
   analysis.

7. To check that the syntax is ok and that the factory can get status
   for sites run it in test/oneshot mode:

    $ /opt/panda/autopyfactory/bin/factory.py --verbose --test --oneshot --log=stdout

    This will define the jdls in the log area, but not actually call
    condor_submit.

8. Run the factory:

       $ nohup /opt/panda/autopyfactory/bin/factory.py [--verbose] &

   Take note of which option you use for output - syslog is now the 
   default. 

Maintinance
-----------

1. If you change something in any of the configuration files then the
   factory will detect this and reload the configuration
   automatically.

2. You'll want to use the vomsrenew.sh script, running out of cron, to
   maintain your voms credentials when thing are working.

3. There is a python script called "cleanLogs.py" which you can
   run from cron. This tar gzips old log directories (default old = 7
   days) and deletes very old ones (default very old = 21 days). 
   
4. If you want to send special pilots then make them available via
   http and use the PILOT_HTTP_SOURCES environment option for that
   queue. N.B. Use the environ setting in schedconfig!

   If you do need to change the wrapper script, remember the condor
   caching bug - create a soft link and update factory.conf to get
   around this.
