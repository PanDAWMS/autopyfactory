      version 2.1.4-1
------------------------------------------

* examples of executables (a.k.a. wrappers) 
  are placed underneath the '/etc/apf/' directory.
  They are not copied directly into '/usr/libexec/' anymore.

  'wrapper-0.9.9.sh' has a different set of
  input options than previous one. 
  Read carefully the inline documentation before using it.

* Config plugins have been removed. 
  Any configuration variable in 'queues.conf'
  related 'PandaConfig' or 'AGISConfig' plugins 
  are not valid anymore. 
  Therefore the variable 'configplugin' is gone too.

  Variables 'override' and 'autofill' are also gone.

* There is a new configuration file called 'monitor.conf'
  An example is provided underneath '/etc/apf/'

  Old variable in 'factory.conf' pointing to the monitor URL
  is now in 'monitor.conf'  

  The 'monitor.conf' contains sections
  for different monitor configurations.
  The name of the section is setup in 'queues.conf' via
  the new variable 'monitorsection'

  Read carefully the inline documentation in
  'monitor.conf' before using it.
