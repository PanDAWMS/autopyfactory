## Configuration settings for the whole factory
# factoryOwner and factoryId are mandatory
# Make factoryId something descriptive and unique for your factory
# schedConfigPollTime is the number of cycles which pass between reloads
# of schedconfig data
# Montoring should be enabled for all factories.

[Factory]
factoryOwner = g.stewart@physics.gla.ac.uk
factoryId = graeme-UK
# condorUser = unixUserName
# schedConfigPollTime = 5
monitorURL =  http://apfmon.lancs.ac.uk/mon/

## Configure the pilots which are sent
# Executable, baseLogDir and baseLogDirUrl are mandatory

[Pilots]
# Executable is the script which will be run by condor. This can contain
# the uuencoded pilot tarball (rebuild with mkPilotWraper.py), but it is now
# recommended only to send the script and let it download the latest
# pilot code from CERN (which it will do automatically).
#
# If you are doing pilot development you can set the PILOT_HTTP_SOURCES variable
# to get your pilot code downloaded on any queue.
#
# *** N.B. there is a caching bug in condor_g which means that changes to this
#  script are not picked up by condor. Best to make a soft link from a 
#  fake name back to the original when you modify this script, e.g,
#  "emacs runpilot3-wrapper.sh"
#  "ln -s runpilot3-wrapper.sh runpilot3-wrapper-1.sh"
#  "executable = runpilot3-wrapper-1.sh"
executable = /opt/panda/autopyfactory/libexec/runpilot3-wrapper.sh
# Where outputs from pilots are stored
baseLogDir = /disk/panda/factory/logs
# Where outputs from pilots are available via http
baseLogDirUrl = http://svr017.gla.scotgrid.ac.uk/factory/logs

## Defaults for queues - these values are set when there is not an explicit value
## If you don't sent them here the factory takes sensible default values, so nothing is mandatory
## see ConfigLoader._configurationDefaults() for these values. 
#
# Most important values can now be detected from schedconfig, so there is no need to set them
# at all. These values are marked with a *. N.B. Even if you do set these values in the factory
# they will be overwritten unless the "override = True" setting is used.
#
#  *status can be "test", "offline" or "online"
#  *nqueue is the number of pilots submitted when the queue falls below nqueue
#  *pilotdepthboost is a multiplying factor which allows more pilots to be submitted than nqueue
#    if there are sufficient activated jobs - helps when the jobs are short
#  *idlepilotsupression makes the single pilot submission to sites with no jobs (the 'hello, panda!' 
#    pilots) only happen every N cycles (Default 1 - i.e., idling pilot every cycle)
#  wallClock and *memory are in minutes and MB - 'None' means nothing is added to JDL
#   Any setting for memory is now used as a flag to the pilot wrapper which will set this 
#   as a ulimit before starting the pilot.
#  jobRecovery switches flag on pilot to enable/disable job recovery.
#     This is generally useless as it is overridden in schedconfig and job recovery
#     is being redeveloped.
#  *pilotlimit sets a hard limit on the total number of pilots at a site, active + queued
#  *transferringlimit sets a limit on the number of jobs in transferring status allowed at a site -
#    when this limit is reached no pilots will be submitted to allow backlogs to clear
#  *cloud is the cloud this queue is in. You should set this to suppress pilot submission when the cloud
#    goes offline
#    N.B. Panda clouds are UPPER CASE, e.g., UK
#  user is the parameter passed to the pilot as the "-u USER" parameter allowing special pilot types
#    to be sent. (Default None for production queues, but "user" for ANALY queues)
#  country is used to pickup jobs only from a particlar VOMS group, e.g., for /atlas/ca users use
#    country = ca. This should only be used when submitting to special analysis resources. On
#    ATLAS pledged resources it should be unset (Default None)
#  allowothercountry is used to allow country specific pilots to pickup extra work using
#    the panda server's 'beyond the pledge' fraction of 'dedicated' vs 'general' running jobs.
#    (Boolean, Default False)
#  group is used to pickup jobs only from a particlar VOMS group, e.g., poweruser0 
#    (Default None)
#  override, if True then schedconfig does not clobber configuration file values.
