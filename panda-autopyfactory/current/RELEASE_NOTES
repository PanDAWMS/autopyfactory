=============================================================================
                    RELEASE SEMANTICS
=============================================================================

AutoPyFactory release versions are composed by 4 numbers:

        major.minor.release-build

For example: 1.2.3-4

* A change in the major number means the entire architecture of 
  AutoPyFactory has been redesign. It implies a change at the conceptual
  level. In other words, changing the major number means a new project. 

* A change in the configuration files that requires sys admins intervention
  after updating implies a change in the minor number.

* Implementing a new relevant feature implies changing the minor number.

* A significative amount of code refactoring that may affect the performance
  of AutoPyFactory -including speed, memory usage, disk usage, etc-
  implies changing the minor number.

* Small features and bug fixes imply changing the release number. 

* A change in the RPM package but not in the code are reflected in the
  build number.

* Not all new releases are placed in the production RPM repository. 
  Many of them are available at the development and testing repositories, 
  but only those that have been verified to work are moved 
  to the production repository. 

* Same RPM will have always the same numbers in all repositories.

* examples of executables (a.k.a. wrappers) 
  are placed underneath the '/etc/apf/' directory.
  They are not copied directly into '/usr/libexec/' anymore.

  'wrapper-0.9.9.sh' has a different set of
  input options than previous one. 
  Read carefully the inline documentation before using it.

* Config plugins have been removed. 
  Any configuration variable in 'queues.conf'
  related 'PandaConfig' or 'AGISConfig' plugins 
  are not valid anymore. 
  Therefore the variable 'configplugin' is gone too.

  Variables 'override' and 'autofill' are also gone.

* There is a new configuration file called 'monitor.conf'
  An example is provided underneath '/etc/apf/'

  Old variable in 'factory.conf' pointing to the monitor URL
  is now in 'monitor.conf'  

  The 'monitor.conf' contains sections
  for different monitor configurations.
  The name of the section is setup in 'queues.conf' via
  the new variable 'monitorsection'

  Read carefully the inline documentation in
  'monitor.conf' before using it.

* Utils, including script to generate 'queues.conf'
  with information from AGIS, have changed name and location.
  New scripts are place underneath '/usr/share/apf'
