##### MOVED TO QUEUE.CONF
# Executable is the script which will be run by condor. This can contain
# the uuencoded pilot tarball (rebuild with mkPilotWraper.py), but it is now
# recommended only to send the script and let it download the latest
# pilot code from CERN (which it will do automatically).
#
# If you are doing pilot development you can set the PILOT_HTTP_SOURCES variable
# to get your pilot code downloaded on any queue.
#
# *** N.B. there is a caching bug in condor_g which means that changes to this
#  script are not picked up by condor. Best to make a soft link from a 
#  fake name back to the original when you modify this script, e.g,
#  "emacs runpilot3-wrapper.sh"
#  "ln -s runpilot3-wrapper.sh runpilot3-wrapper-1.sh"
#  "executable = runpilot3-wrapper-1.sh"
#executable = /usr/libexec/wrapper.sh
